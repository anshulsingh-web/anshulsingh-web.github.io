<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a Master’s student in Mathematics with strong foundation in Mathematics (Pure and Applied) &amp; Statistics, having completed a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Mathematics. My academic interests lie at the intersection of theoretical statistical modeling and data-driven methodology development, with a particular focus on problems where classical assumptions fail due to censoring, missingness and structural dependence arising in real word problems and applied sciences.</p> <p>In my completed Master’s thesis, titled “Multi-Component Stress–Strength Reliability under Middle Censoring,” I developed novel statistical methodologies to rigorously address the theoretical and inferential complexities arising from middle-censored data, under the supervision of <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/joshineeraj" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Dr. Neeraj Joshi</a></strong>. By orchestrating a synergy between <strong>Bayesian methods</strong> and <strong>Classical frequentist approach</strong>, I developed a more robust approach for predicting system failure. This research has been crystallized into a paper, which is communicated for a possible publication. I am currently undertaking an extended Master’s level research project, approved under the Institute’s academic framework, which builds upon my initial thesis work to develop a more comprehensive and unified structure for addressing complex data problems into a unified and extensible framework for inference.</p> <p>My broader research areas include Statistical (Parametric and Non-Parametric) Inference, Bayesian Analysis, Reliability/Survival Analysis, Topological Data Analysis, Probability Theory and Interdisciplinary Statistical Research, along with a technical focus on Statistical Modeling/Computing, programming lanuages such as <strong>Python, R, C/C++</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning for Scientific Data</strong>. I intend to pursue a PhD in Statistics, focusing on problems that demand both mathematical depth and computational innovation, that lead to statistically principled solutions with real-world impact.</p> </body></html>
