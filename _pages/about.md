I am a Master’s student in Mathematics with strong foundation in Mathematics (Pure and Applied) and Statistics. My academic interests lie at the intersection of theoretical statistical modeling and data-driven methodology development, with a particular focus on problems where classical assumptions fail due to censoring, missingness and structural dependence arising in real word problems and applied sciences.

My completed Master’s thesis titled multi-component stress–strength reliability under middle censoring under the supervision of *<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/joshineeraj" target="_blank">Dr. Neeraj Joshi</a>*. In this work, I formulated a novel statistical model that navigates the complexities of Middle Censoring. By orchestrating a synergy between **Bayesian methods** and classical **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**, I developed a more robust approach for predicting system failure. This research has been crystallized into a paper, which is communicated for a possible publication. I am currently working on an extended Master’s-level research project that generalizes Complex data problems into a unified and extensible framework for inference, designed to naturally scale to doctoral-level research.

My broader research areas include Statistical (Parametric and Non-Parametric) Inference, Bayesian Analysis, Reliability/Survival Analysis, Topological Data Analysis, Probability Theory and Interdisciplinary Statistical Research, along with a technical focus on Statistical Modeling/Computing, programming lanuages such as *Python, R, C/C++* and *Machine Learning for Scientific Data*. I intend to pursue a PhD in Statistics, focusing on problems that demand both mathematical depth and computational innovation, and that lead to statistically principled solutions with real-world impact.
